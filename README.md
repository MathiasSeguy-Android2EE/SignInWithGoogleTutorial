SignInWithGoogleTutorial
========================

SignInWithGoogle Tutorial is the dedicated to explain how to use the Google SignIn pattern within your Android Application.
You can see an application sample of that pattern here :https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android2ee.project.gplus.signin.publicid&write_review=true
A conference called "Google Plus SignIn : l'Authentification Google" explaining that code is on Android2EE.com here :http://www.android2ee.com/fr/slideshare/google-authentification-signin-with-google.

#Take care
If you build and run the project you won't be able to run it, you first need to register it with your debugKey in your Google Console Service :https://code.google.com/apis/console
I don't deliver the debug key :)
If you don't understand the last sentence, read the conference, first slides are dedicated to that.
